The computer puts out a random number.
The random number should be from 0 to 2. So there are three numbers.
The numbers are compared and either return rock, paper or scissor.
The function outputs the name the string according to the number.

The playRound() compares the input of the user.
If the computer wins a lose message will be displayed accordingly.
if the user wins a win message will be displayed.
If it's a tie, the console will display a tie.

The game() function allows to play 5 rounds of rock, paper, scissor.

There will be an if function to compare the score of the computer and user each round.
For this there needs to be a loop for each round increasing the score of the winner in each round.
When the player or computer reach a score of 5 the game ends.
